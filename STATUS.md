### Project Setup
- ✅ Created React + TypeScript project using Vite
- ✅ Configured TailwindCSS for styling
- ✅ Set up basic project structure
- ✅ Created initial documentation (PRD.md)

### Core Components
- ✅ `App.tsx`: Main application component with layout
- ✅ `UrlInput.tsx`: URL input component with advanced configuration
- ✅ `AnalysisResults.tsx`: Enhanced results display component
- ✅ `UrlList.tsx`: URL list view with status grouping

### Backend Implementation
- ✅ Created Express server with TypeScript
- ✅ Implemented URL validation and analysis
- ✅ Added SSL certificate checking
- ✅ Integrated robots.txt parsing
- ✅ Implemented depth-first crawling
- ✅ Added sitemap support
- ✅ Configured CORS for Vercel deployment

### Deployment
- ✅ Configured Vercel for frontend and backend
- ✅ Set up proper routing for API endpoints
- ✅ Added environment variable handling
- ✅ Implemented build commands

## Recent Updates (January 8, 2024)

### Build and Type System Improvements
- Fixed TypeScript module resolution by updating `moduleResolution` to "node" in tsconfig.json
- Moved shared types to a dedicated `types.ts` file for better organization
- Fixed export of `firecrawlService` instance to ensure proper module imports
- Resolved build errors related to type definitions and module imports

### API Integration Enhancements
- Updated Firecrawl API integration to use v1 endpoints consistently
- Improved error handling and type safety in API responses
- Enhanced SSL and robots.txt data handling in responses

### URL Crawling Enhancements
- Added comprehensive URL crawling functionality
- Implemented configurable crawl limits
- Added support for sitemap-based crawling
- Enhanced robots.txt compliance checking
- Improved SSL certificate validation

### Error Handling Improvements
- Added detection for:
  - Rate limiting
  - Bot protection
  - SSL certificate issues
  - Network timeouts
  - Access denied errors

### UI/UX Updates
- Enhanced URL list view with:
  - Success/redirect/error grouping
  - Status code display
  - Timestamp information
- Added detailed SSL certificate display
- Improved robots.txt analysis presentation

### Architecture Improvements
- Implemented asynchronous processing
- Added result caching (5-minute expiration)
- Enhanced CORS configuration
- Added detailed logging system

## Next Steps
1. Monitor deployment performance
2. Implement rate limiting per IP
3. Add crawl statistics dashboard
4. Add export functionality
5. Implement concurrent crawling
6. Consider adding database storage

## Known Issues
- Long crawl operations may hit serverless timeouts
- Need production-grade rate limiting
- Consider persistent storage solution
- TailwindCSS content configuration warning
